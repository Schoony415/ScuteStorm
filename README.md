# ScuteStorm

A quick app for calculating Scutes.

This is a difficult and missunderstood calculation when playing a fast game. 

Please reach out if there are any inaccuracies in the numbers.

## finished list:

- basic calculations
- looks like a mtg card
- make buttons a little nicer
- disallow negative numbers
- add svg icons
- subtract scutes and bugs
- +10 / -10

## todo list:

- add multipliers that other cards might cause
- make number boxs nicer
